# bug-tracker-front-end

<p>This project contains the front end for a full stack bug tracking application I am developing.</p>

<p>This application is an issue tracking software that allows users to track the progress of their software projects and track bugs in their code.</p> 

<p>I am using React components for my pages and Vite for my build which has significantly improved the frontend development experience.</p>

<p>You can see a live working demo of the project <a href="https://bug-tracker-2.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
